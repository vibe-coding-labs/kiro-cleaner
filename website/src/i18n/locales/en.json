    "overline": "FAQ",
    "title": "What You Might Want to Know",
    "subtitle": "Frequently asked questions about Kiro Cleaner",
    "q1": "Kiro IDE is lagging, does cleanup really help?",
    "a1": "Very helpful! When local cache is too large, Kiro IDE will obviously slow down and lag. After using Kiro Cleaner to clean redundant data, IDE response speed will significantly improve and take off immediately!",
    "q2": "Will Kiro Cleaner delete my important data?",
    "a2": "No! Kiro Cleaner only cleans cache, temporary files, and old conversation records. Important data like configuration files and current projects will not be touched. Plus, automatic backup is created before cleanup, so you can restore anytime.",
    "q3": "Can Kiro IDE still work normally after cleanup?",
    "a3": "Absolutely! Kiro Cleaner only cleans redundant data and does not affect IDE's normal operation. After cleanup, IDE will run faster and more smoothly.",
    "q4": "How often should I clean?",
    "a4": "It depends on usage frequency. If you use Kiro IDE daily, it's recommended to clean once a week; if usage is less frequent, clean once a month. You can also clean when you notice IDE slowing down.",
    "q5": "Which operating systems are supported?",
    "a5": "Kiro Cleaner supports macOS, Windows, and Linux. As long as you can run Kiro IDE, you can use Kiro Cleaner.",
    "q6": "How to restore cleaned data?",
    "a6": "If you used the --backup parameter during cleanup, a backup will be automatically created. You can use the 'kiro-cleaner backup restore' command to restore data. It's recommended to always use the backup feature.",
